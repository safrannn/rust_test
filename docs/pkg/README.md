# LiveView Technologies WebDev Test
Thank you for your interest in working with us in the LiveView Technologies Web Development team!

In this repo, you'll find the scaffolding for a very basic web app written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using the [Seed](https://seed-rs.org/) library.

Please follow these instructions to get started

## Make sure you have the proper tools installed
To complete this test, you'll need to have git, rustc/cargo ([install here](https://rustup.rs/)), as well as `cargo-make` ([instructions here](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make)) installed on your machine. 

## Fork and clone this repository
Just do that ^

## Run the example
Open a terminal, navigate to where you cloned the project, and run `cargo make watch`. Wait for it to finish building, then open a new terminal window in the same directory and run `cargo make serve`. You should now be able to go to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and view a very simple app that looks like this:

## Build the App!
To complete this test, your app needs to have a the following features:
* A sweet logo at the top (maybe something like [this](https://cameras.liveviewtech.com/img/LVLogo_small.png)?)
* A save button that will add any text currently in the input to a list of items that get displayed in a `<ul>` element.
* A clear button that will remove all items in the list.
* A delete button next to each item that will remove it individually.
* Any other enhancements that you think would improve the user experience.

If you get stuck, be sure to check the Seed [tutorials](https://seed-rs.org/) and/or [API documentation](https://docs.rs/seed/0.7.0/seed/) for any Seed-related issues, or [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

The finished product should look something like this (but hopefully prettier):
